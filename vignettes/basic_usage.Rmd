Hi! Our package `corner` solves a problem with `base::head()` when you have a wide matrix and just want to see the first couple of elements.

```{r setup}
library(corner)
```

## Usage

```{r}
set.seed(20190531)
my_mat <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
corner(my_mat)

here::here('vignettes')
getwd()
```

## Need help?
